# Python

This is for my python scripting practice.

# Best Practices to write code

1. Date input - int, string, map, list ...
2. Data Transformation - List -> String (If user provide input in one type but the business logic   expects in other type)
3. Business Logic - logic to complete our task (Important)
4. Output

# Data Types in Python

1. **int** (Integer): Represents any whole number, positive or negative, without decimals.  
   Example: `age = 23`

2. **float**: Represents any numerical value with a decimal point.  
   Example: `height = 5.5`

3. **str** (String): A sequence of characters, also referred to as a collection of characters or alpha-numeric values.  
   Example: `name = "Karthik"`, `address = "Areclia C 503"`

4. **list**: An ordered collection of items, which can be of any type, and allows duplicates. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation.  
   Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]`

5. **tuple**: Similar to a list, but **immutable**. Once created, the contents of a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed.  
   Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 4)`

6. **set**: An unordered collection of unique items. Sets automatically remove duplicates and are mutable.  
   Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}` or `my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4])`

7. **dict** (Dictionary): Stores values in **key-value pairs**, where each key is unique. Keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers), and the values can be of any data type.  
   Example: `details = {"name": "Karthik", "age": 23, "height": 5.5}`
